fte for DEBIAN
----------------------
  * if you are using some non-iso encondings like KOI8-R please
    check your Compose file if you are worried about warning message.
    This problem is known - if you know how to fix this, please
    let me know.

  * usage of vfte on linux console together with iso8859-X fonts might
    be better if ISOCONSOLE shell variable is set.
    (e.g. for bash  export ISOCONSOLE=y ; fte)

  * before reporting bugs about problems with i18n support for xfte
    try to make sure, your locales are correct and you use them
    properly (e.g.  LANG=en_US xfte)

  * try to use sfte instead of vfte

  * vfte requires access to dev/vcsa*
    as the of the security problem with write access to this device
    this program has to be suid - however only for the opening 
    this device - than it gives up its root privileges and goes
    back to the normal user uid,gid

  * And since vfte uses dev/vcsa directly, you can't use it
    on anything else but a virtual console.

  * vfte is not compiled with GPM support, because it's buggy and
    I didn't want vfte to be the reason to buy a mouse.

  * fte has still bugs, so use with caution (especially vfte, cuz
    it locks the keyboard if it crashes...), and report any
    reproducable bugs found.

  * To make your own configurations, make sure you have the package
    fte-docs installed on your system and unpack the file
    config-example.tar.gz to $HOME/.fte/.
    Run the program: cfte $HOME/.fte/main.fte
    Report any useful improvements and new Color modes.

  * read the BUGS file.
